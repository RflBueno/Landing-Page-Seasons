Autumn
================
Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate
seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter,
in September or March. Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes 
noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.

Winter
================
Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs
between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs
when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.

Summer
================
Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and
before autumn. At or aroundthe summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest
sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day
length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.

Spring
================
Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding
winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but 
local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When
it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and 
vice versa.
